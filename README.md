# Deep Learning
Assignments for the Spring 2019 Deep Learning course at University of Amsterdam

## Assignment 1. MLPs, CNNs and Backpropagation
In this assignment I:
1. Derived analytical gradients for the MLP and Batch Normalization layers. 
2. Implemented Numpy and Pytorch versions of the MLP with custom differentiation layers
3. Pytorch implementation of the simple CNN
## Assignment 2: Recurrent Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks
## Assignment 3: Deep Generative Models
